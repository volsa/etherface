//! Function calls in the Ethereum network are specified by the first four byte of data sent with a transaction.
//! These first four bytes, also called function selector, represent the Keccak256 hash of the functions canonical form (e.g. `balanceOf(address)`).
//! As an outsider it is impossible to interpret what a given transaction does, because hashes are one-way
//! calculations. [Events](https://medium.com/mycrypto/understanding-event-logs-on-the-ethereum-blockchain-f4ae7ba50378)
//! and [errors](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/) are encoded in a similar fashion. As such rainbow tables are
//! needed to decode and inspect such signatures in the Ethereum network. While such rainbow tables exists,
//! most prominently [4Byte](https://www.4byte.directory/), two features are missing which Etherface tries to cover.
//! First, finding such signatures automatically from various websites where such signatures can be found
//! (currently GitHub, Etherscan and 4Byte) without any human intervention whatsoever. Second, providing source code references
//! where these signatures were found. For comparision, 4Byte relies on user submitted data / GitHub Webhooks
//! for the former and does not support the latter at all.
//!
//! The architecture for Etherface looks as follows
//! <div align="center">
//!  <img src="" width="250" height="250"> // TODO: Populate URL
//! </div>
//!
//! The `fetcher` module is thereby responsible for finding [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)
//! files where such signatures are present by either crawling or polling websites whereas the `scraper` module
//! is responsible for downloading these files, scraping all function, event and error signatures inserting
//! them into the database. These scraped signatures are then publicly available at <https://etherface.io/>.
